# Deep learning.
## Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
- Understanding, implementing the math behind forward/backward propagation; differentiating and understanding why/when we use activation functions (tanh, ReLU, sigmoid).
## Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
- Understanding why/how we use methods to optimize algorithm and implementing: Regularization; Momemtum; RMSprop; Adam; Mini-batch size; Batch normalization; tips in tuning hyperparameters process.
## Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
- Strategy to choose the right direction to improve model; Detect the avoidable bias, variance, mismatch data distribution, overfitting; Do error analysis.
## Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Why we use CNN, understand the function of components inside CNN. Understanding the architecture and the target of LeNetâ€‘5, AlexNet, ResNet, Inception Network, Mobile Net, YOLO, U-net, Siamese Network.
